# Shopping-List

A shopping-list UI to add item or remove items, also you can add the quantity.


What have I learned?

- Passing data back with .pop()
- Using ListView.builder
- Dismissible() Widget
- Form() Widget, and connect a form Key to it (GlobalKey)
- Trigger Validation
- The save() method to store the entered values in variables
